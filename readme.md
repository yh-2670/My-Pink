## 📌 Project Overview

> "Menstrual pain isn't just a private issue.  
> It's a public health concern—amplified by silence, misinformation, and inadequate systems.  
> This project bridges the gap with data, education, and empathy."

**My-Pink** is a **gender-inclusive communication tool** delivered as a Chrome browser extension.  
It provides medically accurate, accessible content related to menstrual pain, painkiller usage, institutional coping strategies (school/work), product selection, and foundational education on menstruation.

---

## 🎯 Rationale

- Despite a generally adequate level of awareness, survey-based statistical analysis revealed **communication barriers** to be the most significant obstacle surrounding menstruation.
- Menstruation remains a socially stigmatized topic, often resulting in emotional discomfort when individuals must explain their symptoms or request rest.
- This extension aims to facilitate **informed, stigma-free conversation** by offering a **gender-neutral menstrual health guide** that is accessible to all.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Promote **empathetic, evidence-based understanding** of menstrual health
